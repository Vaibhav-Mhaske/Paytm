# Payment App Prototype

Welcome to the Payment App Prototype repository! This project is a web application designed to simulate money transactions between users. It's built with React for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, MongoDB with Mongoose for data storage, JWT for authentication, Zod for form validation, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in securely using their credentials. JWT tokens are used for authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to user accounts and transaction history.
- **User Dashboard**: Upon logging in, users are greeted with a personalized dashboard displaying their account balance, transaction history, and options for sending and receiving money.
- **Send and Receive Money**: Users can initiate money transfers to other registered users and receive money from others securely within the system.
- **Transaction History**: The application maintains a comprehensive transaction history for each user, allowing them to review past transactions.
